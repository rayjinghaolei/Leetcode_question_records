Question:
    This questions asks to add two binary trees to a new one
    for a position
        1. if they both have values, add them
        2. if one of them don't have value, use the other one
How to solve:
    traverse all the nodes and add them up
    the solution looks very beautiful
    the logic is:
        merge(node1, node2):
            if node1 empty:
                return node2
            if node2 empty:
                return node1
            result = Node(node1.val + node2.val)
            result.left = self.merge(node1.left,node2.left)
            result.right = self.merge(node2.right,node2.right)
            return result
