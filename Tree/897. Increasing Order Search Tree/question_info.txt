Question:
    This questions asks to rearrange the binary search tree to a tree with only right child.
    The resulting right tree is garenteed that parent is always less than the child
How to solve:
    Do an left-node-right traversal (inorder) so that we can access the nodes in a increasing fashion
    when accessing the first node, declear a new variable self.result
    have a pointer pointing to that node
    copy the nodes from the original tree to the new pointer
    return self.result
