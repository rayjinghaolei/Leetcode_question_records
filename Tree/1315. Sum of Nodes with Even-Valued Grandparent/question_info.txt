Question link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent/
Question:
    This questions asks to get the sum of values of nodes which their grandparent's value is even
How to solve:
    dfs the tree
    check the grandparent and see if it has even value

    the key is to set up a dfs function with node, parent and grandparent as parameters
    when doing the recursive call you call dfs(node.left, node, parent)
    and you start by calling dfs(root, None, None)

    note that the key word nonlocal is used when you want to modify the variable ourside the function.
